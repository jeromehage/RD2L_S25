# RD2L_S25

### Mission statement

Hello. I like Dota 2. I like to think about the game and to play it. This season I want to create an environment where a team can study and apply Dota 2 concepts. It must be fun; relaxed yet competitive. This is why I will organize the team's schedule as follows:

<br/>

Saturday: 4 hours
- [optional] 6 PM CET : Present weekly objective. Brainstorm ideas to achieve targets. Team lobby practice, testing mechanics, etc..
- [optional] 7 PM CET : Applying theory in a pub match. The goal is to focus entirely on ONE idea and apply it.
- [important] 8 PM CET : Battlecup or scrim. Continue to actively apply theory, now in a competitive environment.

Sunday: 4 hours (+2 scouting)
- [optional] 4 PM CET : Scouting for next opponent. Anyone is free to join.
- [optional] 6 PM CET : Warm-up pub match. The goal is to think as little as possible. What we learned yesterday is enough.
- [critical] 8 PM CET : RD2L matches.

#### Player profile:
- Div 3 player (in general < 4k mmr). Even if you're herald 1, if you're interested I will pick you.
- Able to dedicate at least 4 hours of your weekend for Dota 2.
- Willing to learn, flexible.

#### Code of conduct:
- Be nice.
- Have fun, good results are a consequence not the objective.
- Majority vote (3/5).
- Time slots can be moved around as team sees fit (ex: to watch a DPC match).
